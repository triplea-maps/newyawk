The year is 2020, the battle for new yawk. It is ugly. Leaders and femdoms (female fighting units!!) are artillery (generals), they support infantry, halftrac and cavalry. Every territory has an invisible factory so don't tic that box about not blitzing through factories. Do tic unit placement per territory restricted and place in any territory. There are land bridges and no ships. Units are as follows:
aagun a0 d1 m1 c8 
femdom a2 d2 m1 c6 gives support 
armour a3 d3 m2 c6 can blitz
cannon a2 d1 m1 c3
cavalry a2 d1 m2 c4  supported can blitz
factory a0 d0 m0 c0
halftrac a2 d2 m2 c5 supported can blitz
copter a4 d2 m4 c8 air
infantry a1 d2 m1 c3 supported 
jeep a1 d2 m2 c3 
drones a3 d1 m5 c6 air
dogs a1 d1 m1 c2
bunker a0 d1 m0 c0
leader a2 d3 m1 c7 gives support
Depending on your faction your leaders might be called rappers, lama, rabbis, matadors, imams, pushers or captains. Make 7 players more n. able, dynamix doesn't work. Must have a sense of humor to play. Not a PC game.
